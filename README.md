# Looking back at Octant's funding to open source in 2024
In 2024, Octant supported 47 open source software teams across four epochs. The funded projects have been diverse in scope, ranging from privacy-focused tools like Tor to ecosystem analytics platforms like L2Beat to up-and-coming organizations like the GreenPill Developer Guild.

This app explores some high-level trends in developer activity over the past year. As these projects have different missions and objectives (and not all are open source software projects), one should not attempt to directly compare their impact or productivity. Nonetheless, we hope these insights can highlight ongoing contributions, identify growth areas, and provide additional context on what each project has been up to.

The analysis spans four key areas:
- Project Trends Across Epochs
- Developer Productivity and Funding Efficiency
- Customized Rankings for Top Projects
- Strategic Insights Through Clustering
